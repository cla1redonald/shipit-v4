# /gameplan -- Implementation Plan

**Usage:** `/gameplan <feature-description-or-spec-path>`
**Example:** `/gameplan "Add dark mode toggle"` or `/gameplan docs/specs/dark-mode-toggle.md`

## When to Use

- You have a spec or clear idea and want a plan before building
- You want to understand complexity and file changes before committing
- You're about to start the build phase and want it to have a plan to follow
- NOT for: exploring what to build (use `/spec` first)

**Cost:** No agent spawns. Runs inline.

## Process

1. **Check for existing spec.** Look for `docs/specs/<slug>.md`. If found, read it.
2. **Read the codebase.** Understand structure, patterns, test setup, relevant files.
3. **Assess complexity:**

| Level | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| Low | 1-3 files, established patterns |
| Medium | 4-8 files, some new patterns |
| Medium-High | 8-15 files, architecture decisions |
| High | 15+ files, novel problems, security-sensitive |

4. **Write the gameplan** to `docs/gameplans/<slug>.md`:

```markdown
# Gameplan: [Feature Name]

**Spec:** [path to spec, or "none — working from description"]
**Complexity:** Low | Medium | Medium-High | High
**Estimated files:** N

## Steps
1. [Step — what to do, which files to create/modify, why]
2. [Step — note dependencies on previous steps]
...

## Dependencies
[Which steps depend on which — informs parallel execution]

## Risks
[What could go wrong and how to mitigate]
```

5. **Present the gameplan** to the user for review.
6. **Commit** the gameplan file.

## Anti-Rationalization

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "The feature is simple, I don't need a plan" | Simple features have simple plans. Write it in 2 minutes. |
| "Planning is overhead, let me just build" | Building without a plan means discovering the plan while debugging. |
| "I know which files to change" | Write them down. The next agent doesn't know what you're thinking. |
| "Risks section is pessimistic" | Risks section is realistic. Name them now or discover them at midnight. |
| "I'll assess complexity as I go" | Complexity drives resource decisions. Assess it upfront. |

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] Gameplan file exists at `docs/gameplans/<slug>.md`
- [ ] Complexity assessed
- [ ] All steps have concrete file paths
- [ ] Dependencies documented
- [ ] Risks identified with mitigations
- [ ] If the plan touches an **architectural surface** (data model, schema, API boundary, a new external integration, a new dependency), **`@architect` summoned to review the design** before implementation begins — PLAN time is the architect's highest-value moment (the wild run's best ROI). ShipIt's `specialist-nudge` also flags this when a `docs/plans/*.md` / PRD is staged, but here is earlier and better.
- [ ] User has reviewed and approved
- [ ] Gameplan committed to git

## Failure Recovery

| Problem | Action |
|---------|--------|
| No spec and description is vague | Run `/spec` first, then come back |
| Complexity is High | Flag to user — may need decomposition |
| Can't determine file structure | Read ARCHITECTURE.md or explore codebase more |
| All steps are sequential | Look for parallel opportunities |
